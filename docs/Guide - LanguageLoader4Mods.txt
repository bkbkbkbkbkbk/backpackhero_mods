LanguageLoader4Mods is a mod for enabling Multi-Lingual supports for other mods.

this is how to use it: 

   1. inside folder "Backpack Hero_Data/StreamingAssets/Language/mods", create a folder "YourModName"
   2. inside YourModName/, create a csv file for each language you wanna support.
   3. you may use any .csv file from StreamingAssets/Language/ as a reference
   

General Guide Line of how to choose your key:
    Just use the whole english text string as your key. 
    In this way, it will usually not conflict with any official key; 
    Additionally, if the key eventually clashes with keys from other mods, the translated text will likely be the same
